# 🧬 EvolveCode: Adaptive AI Coding Platform

> **Winner of the Kaggle Adaptive Learning Hackathon (Simulation)**

EvolveCode is a revolutionary coding platform that grows with the user. It starts as a simple, block-based game for children and "evolves" into a full-featured Professional IDE as skills improve, powered by AI through OpenRouter.

## 🔗 Live Demo & Links

- **Live App Demo**: [PASTE YOUR VERCEL/NETLIFY LINK HERE]
- **Kaggle Notebook**: [PASTE YOUR KAGGLE NOTEBOOK LINK HERE]
- **Dataset**: `data/user_progression.csv`

## 🚀 Features

- **Adaptive Interface**: 4 Distinct stages (Kids, Tween, Teen, Pro) that change UI/UX drastically.
- **AI Evolution Engine**: Click "Evolve" to translate logic blocks into real Python code instantly using AI.
- **Context-Aware Tutor**: The AI assistant changes its personality (Emojis vs Technical Jargon) based on the user's current stage.
- **Progression ML**: Built-in Predictive model (see `evolve-code-hackathon.ipynb`) determines when a user is ready to level up.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: OpenRouter API (Multi-provider AI access)
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor (Simulated for this demo)
- **Data Science**: Python, Scikit-learn (in Notebook)

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### 1. Web App (React)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** Configure your OpenRouter API key in `backend/config/config.php` for AI features.

### 2. Standalone Demo

Simply open `demo/index.html` in any modern browser. No installation required.

### 3. Kaggle Notebook

Upload `evolve-code-hackathon.ipynb` to Kaggle kernels or run locally with Jupyter Lab.

## 🚢 Deployment

**Vercel / Netlify:**

```bash
npm run build
vercel deploy --prod
```
