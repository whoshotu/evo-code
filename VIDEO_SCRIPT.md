**[0:00-0:15] Hook: The Problem**
*(Visual: Split screen. Left: A frustrated kid looking at complex code. Right: A bored pro developer using Scratch.)*
**Voiceover:** "Learning to code is broken. Kids' tools are too simple, and professional tools are too scary. There is no bridge. Until now."

**[0:15-0:35] The Solution: Adaptive UX**
*(Visual: Screen recording of EvolveCode. User clicks 'Evolve' button. The UI morphs instantly from Kids Mode -> Tween Mode -> Pro IDE.)*
**Voiceover:** "Meet EvolveCode. The world's first adaptive coding platform. Powered by Gemini 2.5, it transforms the interface *and* the code logic instantly. What starts as a 'Magic Loop' block for an 8-year-old..."
*(Visual: Zoom in on code transformation)*
**Voiceover:** "...becomes a standard Python `for` loop for a teenager, preserving the logic but evolving the syntax."

**[0:35-0:60] Under the Hood: AI & ML**
*(Visual: Show the Kaggle Notebook graphs and the AI Assistant chat)*
**Voiceover:** "Our built-in AI Tutor adapts its personality. For kids, it uses emojis and metaphors. For pros, it talks Big-O notation and clean architecture. Plus, our Scikit-Learn model analyzes behavior to predict exactly when a student is ready to level up."

**[1:00-1:20] Tech Stack**
*(Visual: Fast flashes of logos: React, Tailwind, Gemini API, Python, Vercel)*
**Voiceover:** "Built with React, Tailwind, and the Gemini API, EvolveCode is offline-ready and blazing fast. We aren't just teaching syntax; we're guiding the cognitive leap from concrete thinking to abstract engineering."
